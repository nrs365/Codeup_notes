php - 

$poem = <<<POEM
There was a young man of Japan
Whose limericks never would scan.
When asked why this was,
He replied "It's because
I always try to fit as many syllables into the last line as ever I possibly can.
POEM; (must be on new line to close the herenow

<<< can be caps or lowercase - will work either way
caps just makes it stand out more
can use var inside to have var interpolation

define(ALL CAPS, value); (you can put it in lowercase but BP is caps) - define can't be used in line in a string, can only be used with concat with string


define('MY_NAME', 'Ben');
define(MY_NAME, 'Batschelet');
echo MY_NAME; -> Ben
echo Ben; -> Batschelet

arrays -composites of data types, not scalar
scalar?  simple?  something with echo?
scalar vs primitive data types

data types/subtypes:
scalar is boolean, integer, float, string
compound - array, object
special - resource, null

print_r($name);
$my_name = array('Ben', 'Batschelet'); (older syntax - anything less than php 5.4)
$my_name = ['Ben', 'Batschelet']; - - both are acceptable syntax; backwards compat
numeric arrays - $variable[index]
use single quotes in arrays
$my_name = ['first' => 'John', 'last' => 'Doe']; (how to declare/define an associative array)

multi-dimensional array - $user = array('name' => array('first' => 'John', 'last' => 'Doe'));
print_r ($user['name']['first']);
______________________________
static vs. dynamic
php dynamically typed language
don't complile with php
compilation (manual step) happens before you run the code - looks at source code and then interprets it and complies it
interpreted lang like php - in the browser - it'll have the source code, but web server interprets it and then produces a result


arrays again - $todos[0] = 'get groceries'; (replaced in the array)
echo $todos[1]; - print just the single entry as specified in the index

php returns the associative array in the order it was input/defined by the index; index (numeric or key value store) arrays will always return in numeric order

thinking of multidimensional arrays - table with rows and collums
$rows = array (
array(1,2,3,4),
array(5,6,7,8),
array(9,10,11,12)
);
$rows = [ 
[1,2,3,4],
[5,6,7,8],
[9,10,11,12]
];

accessing multi dem array - looking for 7;
echo $rows[1][2];

$rows = [1 => ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3, 'd' =>4],
[2 => 'a' => 5, 'b' => 6, 'c' => 7, 'd' => 8]etc];
echo $rows ['1']['b'];

echo $rows['3']['d'];

assigning the reference of the variable x into y
$some_number = 5;
php > $another_number = &$some_number;
php > echo $another_number;
5
so whatever is in x is going to be in y
pass by reference and pass by value(making an alias that points to another var) (don't worry about it right now)
key thing seems to be that when the assignment happens of y based on x, when x changes y stays the same.  doesn't updated when changes happen.  when using assignment by reference is used, it DOES update and change instead of staying fixed

takeaway from type casting - we're really bad at assuming what the computer is going to do.  languages cast differently and so yea.

Incrementing/decrementing
$a == $b	Equal	TRUE if $a is equal to $b after type juggling.
$a === $b	Identical	TRUE if $a is equal to $b, and they are of the same type.
$a != $b	Not equal	TRUE if $a is not equal to $b after type juggling.

++$a	Pre-increment	Increments $a by one, then returns $a. (will never return original value, will only return next value)
$a++	Post-increment	Returns $a, then increments $a by one.
--$a	Pre-decrement	Decrements $a by one, then returns $a.
$a--	Post-decrement	Returns $a, then decrements $a by one.

takeaways from incrementing- a) don't do more than one thing at a time; don't echo and increment/decrement at the same time, and b) possibly something about not being an asshole - edit: if you see other people doing it you will hate them

####logical operators: and, ||, !, &&,
xor - exclusive or - one or the other but not both;
|| - inclusive or - one or the other or both true;
&& has operator precedence over ||
